## Description

Welcome to this Javascript project which is focused on  exploring the power of  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs allow developers to extend web browsers' functionalities using JavaScript, opening up a world of dynamic and interactive possibilities. In this project, I delved into the Web API, starting with the essential Document Object Model (DOM).



Welcome to the Module 6 Challenge: Web APIs Code Quiz! In this project, you will build a dynamic, timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This quiz application is designed for coding boot camp students to test their knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. It will also store high scores so that users can compare their progress with their peers.

## User Story

As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## Feautures

The code quiz has the following features:

- A start button that, when clicked, starts a timer and displays the first question.
- Questions with buttons for each answer.
- When an answer is clicked, the next question appears.
- If an incorrect answer is selected, time is deducted from the clock.
- The quiz ends when all questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0.
- At the end of the quiz, it displays the user's score and allows them to save their initials and score.

## How to Run the Application

To run the application, you can visit the live URL where it's deployed. 

Additionally, you can clone the project repository and open the HTML file in a web browser.

### The Power of Web APIs

Some APIs are already built directly into web browsers. When a web page loads, a virtual representation of the page known as the Document Object Model (DOM) is created. This DOM allows us to leverage JavaScript to interact with HTML elements, transforming static web content into dynamic and engaging user experiences.

Throughout this module, you'll develop practical skills in:

- Navigating and manipulating the DOM.
- Adding event listeners to elements and managing events.
- Implementing timers and intervals for enhanced interactivity.
- Storing and persisting data on the client side.


### The DOM and Web APIs

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a crucial concept in web development. It represents an in-memory object-oriented version of an HTML document. With the DOM, you can use JavaScript to interact with HTML, enabling you to select elements, retrieve content, insert content, generate new elements, and respond to events like clicks or key presses.

As you progress through this module, you'll explore the intricacies of Web APIs and their role in creating dynamic web applications. You'll learn to navigate the DOM, manipulate HTML elements, add event listeners, implement timers, and store data—all using the power of JavaScript and the browser's built-in APIs.

### What's Ahead

#### Module 6.1 - Introduction to Web APIs

This section introduces the DOM and various Web APIs. You'll learn to inspect the Window object, traverse the DOM, query elements, set attributes, create and append elements, and work with timers.

#### 6.1 Introduction to Web APIs

In this section, you'll get acquainted with the Document Object Model (DOM). You'll explore various Web APIs to access, create, and modify elements. Along the way, you'll learn about attributes and timers while reinforcing your existing JavaScript skills.

#### 6.2 Events

Here, you'll delve into the realm of event handling. You'll master the art of adding event listeners to DOM elements, preventing default behavior, and controlling event propagation. Additionally, you'll discover the power of data attributes for storing information within HTML elements.

#### Module 6.2 - Events

In this part, you'll delve into event handling. You'll master the art of adding event listeners, preventing default behaviors, stopping event propagation, and working with keyboard events and data attributes.


#### Module 6.3 - Client-Side Storage

Discover the world of client-side storage APIs. Learn to store data using localStorage, convert objects to JSON strings, and persist data using client-side storage. Wrap up the module with a mini-project: crafting a Word Guess Game.

#### 6.3 Client-Side Storage

This section delves into the realm of client-side storage. You'll learn how to utilize storage APIs to persist data within your applications. To cap off your learning, you'll embark on a mini-project: crafting a Word Guess Game that brings together your newly acquired skills.

#### 6.4 Code Quiz Challenge

This Challenge is your chance to put everything you've learned into action. You'll create a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz complete with high-score tracking. This interactive app will be powered by JavaScript and will showcase your proficiency in creating a polished, responsive user interface.

#### Module 6.4 - Code Quiz Challenge

Put your skills to the test with the Code Quiz Challenge. Build a timed, multiple-choice quiz that tracks high scores. Create a polished, responsive user interface using JavaScript and showcase your mastery of Web APIs.
