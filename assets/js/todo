I am stuck with getting the onClick event to register the correct userResponse. I deleted a bit of code to start over. 

Areas still to be developed:

saving users response to localstorage
compare local storage and then count correct answer.
store amount of correct answers and show this on the page once the time is completed.
still to use sound for incorrect or correct elements.
etc.
